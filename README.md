Assuming uptime is installed in C:\Program Files\Uptime Software\Uptime, you can use remove MS-exchange-2013-noagent.bat to remove the plugin after it has been installed if you need to do that. The command inside is a standard command used to administer uptime and is used for removing custom plugins added via "the-grid" or otherwise.
